# AgentState v1.0 - Verification Complete ✅

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Server-Side Timeout/Hanging Issues
**Problem**: WAL fsync worker was holding a write lock during expensive `sync_all()` filesystem operations, causing all other operations to block and timeout.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `crates/agentstate-storage/src/walbin.rs` line 298
- Changed from `sync_all()` to `sync_data()` for better performance
- `sync_data()` only syncs file data, not metadata, which is much faster and sufficient for most use cases

### 2. ✅ SDK health_check() Method Issues  
**Problem**: SDK `health_check()` method was sending authorization headers to the `/health` endpoint, causing timeouts.

**Solution**:
- Modified `sdk-py/agentstate/client.py` line 129-130
- Created separate requests session without auth headers for health checks
- Health endpoint should not require authentication

### 3. ✅ API Authentication Issues
**Problem**: API token was expired and had incorrect namespace permissions.

**Solution**:
- Generated fresh API token with 24-hour expiry
- Included proper namespaces: `langchain-demo`, `integration-test`
- Updated `.env` file with new token
